1. How to use the testcase 'csky-dmatest' ?

1) build the testcase when building the linux kernel

	The case 'csky-dmatest' is a kernel module, so it can only be used in kernel.

	build steps:
	a) Copy csky-dmatest.c into drivers/dma/
	b) Add the following line into drivers/dma/Makefile:
		obj-y += csky-dmatest.o
	c) Rebuild the kernel.
